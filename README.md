Installation Instructions
-----
#### Please create and provide the user acquia_support with the following permissions:
  * R+W+X for all site docroot files within dev, staging and production.
  * R+W+X for all VCS folders and files.
  * X for drush folder, RW if you would like acquia_support to be able to update drush itself.
  * R+W+X for mysql databases, ability to run mysql.
  * R for all log files.

#### To initially setup the ssh folder for the acquia_support user, run this command: 

mkdir -pm 700 ~/.ssh > /dev/null 2>&1 ; curl --silent --write-out \%{http_code} https://raw.github.com/acquia/support_keys/master/authorized_keys --output ~/.ssh/authorized_keys_dl 2> /dev/null | grep 200 > /dev/null && mv -f ~/.ssh/authorized_keys_dl ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys > /dev/null 2>&1

#### Update the ssh folder via crontab:
Run 'crontab -e' and add this line:

0 0 * * * mkdir -pm 700 ~/.ssh > /dev/null 2>&1 ; curl --silent --write-out \%{http_code} https://raw.github.com/acquia/support_keys/master/authorized_keys --output ~/.ssh/authorized_keys_dl 2> /dev/null | grep 200 > /dev/null && mv -f ~/.ssh/authorized_keys_dl ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys > /dev/null 2>&1

This crontab runs every day at midnight (you may change the time), creating and updating a folder which contains the authorized public key files of Acquia Client Advisors.
